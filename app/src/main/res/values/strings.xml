    <string name="legal_info">Thank you for using the app Babbling Bubble!!\n\nThis app was a joint effort by the Kulkarni Family. Vedant Kulkarni wrote the code for the app. Siddhant Kulkarni and Rahul Kulkarni gave design inputs and without them, the wonderful UX that the app has would not have been pssible. Madhura Kulkarni gave end-user inputs and helped add features that would appeal to the user.\n\nThe icons here were taken from "The Noun Project" on www.thenounproject.com and "Flaticon" on www.flaticon.com\nColours were chosen using the help of the "Material Design - Colour Picker" on www.material.io/tools/color/ </string>
